I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, with a focus on machine learning and data-driven applications. I have extensive research and industry experience in building AI solutions, particularly in healthcare. My work spans across Generative AI technology, computer vision, natural language processing, and trustworthy machine learning.

I received my Bachelor’s in Computer Science and Engineering with Honors from IIIT Sri City, where I gained research experience in transfer learning, image classification, and ML model robustness. I was also awarded the MITACS Globalink fellowship (CAN $9,000) which gave me the opportunity to work in-person at Trustworthy AI Lab at Toronto Metropolitan University, Canada. Before starting graduate school, I worked as a Machine Learning Research Engineer at AutomationEdge Technologies, developing generative AI solutions to automate tasks in healthcare, with direct impact on improving the quality of patient care and optimizing intake workflows.

I am always on the lookout for opportunities in data science, machine learning engineering, and backend development. Please feel free to reach out to discuss collaboration on projects or other potential opportunities.
