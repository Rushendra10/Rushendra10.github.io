excerpt: 'We developed a system using LLMs for date speech detection and target identification in Devanagari-script languages (low resource languages). Our approach leverages quantized LLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to achieve a highly resource-optimized pipeline. Our system demonstrated a strong performance on the challenging low-resource tasks while utilizing one of the lowest compute footprints among the other studies.'

**Abstract**
The detection of hate speech has become increasingly important in combating online hostility and its real-world consequences. Despite recent advancements, there is limited research addressing hate speech detection in Devanagari-scripted languages, where resources and tools are scarce. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in language-related tasks, traditional fine-tuning approaches are often infeasible given the size of the models. In this paper, we propose a Parameter Efficient Fine tuning (PEFT) based solution for hate speech detection and target identification. We evaluate multiple LLMs on the Devanagari dataset provided by (Thapa et al., 2025), which contains annotated instances in 2 languages - Hindi and Nepali. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in handling Devanagari-scripted content.
