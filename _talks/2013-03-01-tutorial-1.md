As the president of Epoch, the AIML club, I had the opportunity to speak to freshmen students, which brought back memories of my own time in those same classrooms, eager to attend the club's introductory session. It was rewarding to impart knowledge and give back to the club that shaped my early interest in machine learning. I later went on to mentor 20 of these students, guiding them as they began their own journey.
