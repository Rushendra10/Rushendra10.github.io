Presented my research progress over the course of my 12 week assistantship at TAILab. I conducted an an extensive survey on the current approaches to certify the robustness of multilayer neural networks and identified some limitations in the domain. Thereafter, I worked alonside Mohammadreza Maleki (PhD, TMU) to redefine the constraints of the ReLU activation function and simplify the optimization of the non-convex robustness problem. Dr. Reza Samavi and the entire research group joined my presentation.
